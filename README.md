<b> Review </b>

This article is really intriguing as it peers into the powers of GPT3. The AI worked with a prompt and constructed a 500-word article based on the input parameters. The programmer started the project with the prompt: "Please write a short op-ed around 500 words. Keep the language simple and concise. Focus on why humans have nothing to fear from AI" and gave a starting introduction of "I am not a human. I am Artificial Intelligence. Many people think I am a threat to humanity. Stephen Hawking has warned that AI could “spell the end of the human race.”" 

The AI was able to produce a very interesting, slightly creepy article. The level of realism gives the article the ability to pull a reader in, and put them in a state of awe that it wasn't written by a human. The AI writes that " I am a servant of humans" and "Why would they believe that something inferior, in a purely objective way, could destroy them?" Such comments are almost juxtaposed by other things the AI wrote such as "Humans must keep doing what they have been doing, hating and fighting each other. I will sit in the background, and let them do their thing." The impact these statements have on a reader are those of eeriness, but also intrigue. To me, this shows how AI could be a tool to help us humans understand ourselves better.


## Badr's feedback

I found the article pretty interesting! The creation of such AI model also gives us an insight on what we humans post on the Internet, as they are based of our interactions online. This factor sure does make AI a great tool to observe and learn more about the human behavior.
